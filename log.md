### Day 1: January 27, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Started the Tribute page challenge at codecamp.
**Thoughts:** I Knew what i was doing, but i spent to much time planing it out, ended with just the basic html structure. I still don't know how i will style it.

### Day 2: January 28, 2018
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: I made the image and text to be side by side.
**Thoughts:** I Battled a lot with this, i tried changing widths, paddings displays, all to make it look how i had it in my mind, safe to say i couldn't do it today. I spent too much time into it maybe i should just make it standard, I'll try tomorrow again. Result: image to the right text to the left.

### Day 3: January 28, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Main image is now styled to resemble a portrait photo, text and image are now side by side properly, info text is properly separated, added an image to info text.
**Thoughts:** Todays work flow was a lot smoother, i learned that i should search more efitienly on google, relaying more on technical terms, with less words so it searches for what i really want and not subjectivelly. I'm really happy with the imrovement of the page, but i'm not content with it so i'll keep working to make it how i want it to be if only a little. I don't know if this passes the challenge bar.

<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Tribute page completed
**Thoughts:** I think the page is ready, i added margin to cointainers, completed text and paragraphs, it didn't take much time, i'm satisfied with the result but i probably will revisit the page in the future when my skill are better.

### Day 5: January 31, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Tribute page completed
**Thoughts:** I should update earlier. Started the Personal Portfolio Webpage challenge at freecodecamp, i didn't code much today, but i spent time learning bootstrap and finding references for the challenge, i want to make it beautiful and responsive and interactive with buttons that make apear a unicorn in your house, but experience dictates that i should just probably just build a functional website and adding just a bit of touch to it since it will eat most of my time if i search 'how to interact with html'. Anyway, Let's see if i can finish it tomorrow.

### Day 6: february 1, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Navbar and showcase styled
**Thoughts:** I learned quite a bit of bootstrap today, for example, the nav class doesn't work the sameway in 3.7 and 4, i think it doesn't even work in 4 but i don't know, I really should update earlier. Most of my time was sepent learning, but i feel great because the page for my portfolio looks great and moder, even responsive, yay bootstrap!. tired i don't know what else to say.

### Day 7: february 2, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Navbar and showcase re-styled, added text and thumbnail images.
**Thoughts:** I spent too much time re-styling the navbar and showcase, i was fighting with the navbar because content keep disapearing behind it, also re-coded the showcase as i didn't think it was ideal to have a background-image as property instead of making a div with an img tag in it, boy i was wrong, so all the time spent re-doing was for nothing project-wise but i learned stuff, i read a bit of bootstrap and thats it i think, body... tired...

### Day 8: february 3, 2018 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Thumbnail grid styled, added contact div.
**Thoughts:** Today i realized again why people like bootstrap, i spent some time re-sizing the showcase, the text wasn't centered and was too big, the grid i added yesterday was styled properly and centered, wasn't hard but took time. Added a conctact div with bootstrap, since i probably add links to facebook and such i figured i need icons, so this is the first time using fontawesome and it seems it doesn't get algong with bootstrap, i'll fix it tomorrow.

### Day 9: february 4, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Link to social accounts added, not styled yet.
**Thoughts:** I didn't advanced as i wanted today, figuring how to display the contact div was time consuming, i think i still overthink too much. Figured why the grid thumbnail wasn't well centered. Used github a bit today.

### Day 10: february 5, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Website completed
**Thoughts:** The webpage fullfills the requisits for the freecodecamp challange, The page doesn't have much content but i'll keep updating it as my experience grows.

### Day 11: february 6, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Learned bootstrap, html dom, and revisted js basics
**Thoughts:** Today i din't code, but spent time learning, from bootstrap to html dom. I learned some of the basics of the javascript i hadn't seen before in freecodecamp, I spent half an hour looking for how to make a count down, I want to make one but everything i've seen is related to dates, i want to make it accept input as time limit, i'll try to keep looking into it. Also in day 8 i checked the tribute page for ada lovelace and something was terribly wrong i'll try to fix it, bad news is it's already submitted to freecodecamp, i wonder if it'll affect anything...

### Day 12: february 7, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Learned bootstrap, html dom, and revisted js basics AGAIN
**Thoughts:** Same as yesterday, freecodecamp course, w3schools bootstrap and HTML DOM tutorial. I wish i could code something fancy...

### Day 13: february 8, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML DOM
**Thoughts:** I didn't work too much today, but i managed to learn a bit of dom and i'm trying to make an animation with it, i don't want it to be fancy, it should be simple, for the moment i have a circle made with css, now i'm trying to animate it, the animation should be some kind of shine, it should make it look a bit 3D re-read some of what i read and learned more in stack-overflow.

### Day 14: february 9, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Advanced the challanges at freecodecamp, Advanced a bit of bootstrap, and re-read html basics at w3schools. Tried to make animation work, still needs progress.
**Thoughts:** I worked in freecodecamp today with the help of the pomodoro technique, it's quite cool, relearned js basics and advanced at w3schools, I'm reading the html tutorial, and it isn't as hard as it was in the begining i advanced a lot in an hour, probably i'll finish it in a day or two maybe. I don't know if i should read the css tutorial too. The animation i was trying to do with DOM is going to take more time than i thought, i'll stop for the time beign.

### Day 15: february 10, 2018
###

**Today's Progress**: Advanced the challanges at freecodecamp at good pace.
**Thoughts:** I advanced in freecodecamp now i'm at the challenge 200!, Learned a lot even though i already saw most of the basics of js, the challenges were entretaining. I really like the style of learning there. The animation i was trying to do had an unexpected result, the shine which was supposed to move inside the circle escapes the cursor!, its funny to me, I'm just glad it does something contrary to doing nothing.
