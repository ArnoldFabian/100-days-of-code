**Today's Progress**: Started the Tribute page challenge at codecamp.
**Thoughts:** I Knew what i was doing, but i spent to much time planing it out, ended with just the basic html structure. I still don't know how i will style it.

**Today's Progress**: I made the image and text to be side by side.
**Thoughts:** I Battled a lot with this, i tried changing widths, paddings displays, all to make it look how i had it in my mind, safe to say i couldn't do it today. I spent too much time into it maybe i should just make it standard, I'll try tomorrow again. Result: image to the right text to the left.
