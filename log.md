**Today's Progress**: Started the Tribute page challenge at codecamp.
**Thoughts:** I Knew what i was doing, but i spent to much time planing it out, ended with just the basic html structure. I still don't know how i will style it.

**Today's Progress**: I made the image and text to be side by side.
**Thoughts:** I Battled a lot with this, i tried changing widths, paddings displays, all to make it look how i had it in my mind, safe to say i couldn't do it today. I spent too much time into it maybe i should just make it standard, I'll try tomorrow again. Result: image to the right text to the left.

### Day 3: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Main image is now styled to resemble a portrait photo, text and image are now side by side properly, info text is properly separated, added an image to info text.
**Thoughts:** Todays work flow was a lot smoother, i learned that i should search more efitienly on google, relaying more on technical terms, with less words so it searches for what i really want and not subjectivelly. I'm really happy with the imrovement of the page, but i'm not content with it so i'll keep working to make it how i want it to be if only a little. I don't know if this passes the challenge bar.

**Today's Progress**: Tribute page completed
**Thoughts:** I think the page is ready, i added margin to cointainers, completed text and paragraphs, it didn't take much time, i'm satisfied with the result but i probably will revisit the page in the future when my skill are better.

### Day 5: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tribute page completed
**Thoughts:** I should update earlier. Started the Personal Portfolio Webpage challenge at freecodecamp, i didn't code much today, but i spent time learning bootstrap and finding references for the challenge, i want to make it beautiful and responsive and interactive with buttons that make apear a unicorn in your house, but experience dictates that i should just probably just build a functional website and adding just a bit of touch to it since it will eat most of my time if i search 'how to interact with html'. Anyway, Let's see if i can finish it tomorrow.

### Day 6: february 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Navbar and showcase styled
**Thoughts:** I learned quite a bit of bootstrap today, for example, the nav class doesn't work the sameway in 3.7 and 4, i think it doesn't even work in 4 but i don't know, I really should update earlier. Most of my time was sepent learning, but i feel great because the page for my portfolio looks great and moder, even responsive, yay bootstrap!. tired i don't know what else to say.
