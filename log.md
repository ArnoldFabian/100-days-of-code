**Today's Progress**: Started the Tribute page challenge at codecamp.
**Thoughts:** I Knew what i was doing, but i spent to much time planing it out, ended with just the basic html structure. I still don't know how i will style it.

**Today's Progress**: I made the image and text to be side by side.
**Thoughts:** I Battled a lot with this, i tried changing widths, paddings displays, all to make it look how i had it in my mind, safe to say i couldn't do it today. I spent too much time into it maybe i should just make it standard, I'll try tomorrow again. Result: image to the right text to the left.

### Day 3: January 28, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Main image is now styled to resemble a portrait photo, text and image are now side by side properly, info text is properly separated, added an image to info text.
**Thoughts:** Todays work flow was a lot smoother, i learned that i should search more efitienly on google, relaying more on technical terms, with less words so it searches for what i really want and not subjectivelly. I'm really happy with the imrovement of the page, but i'm not content with it so i'll keep working to make it how i want it to be if only a little. I don't know if this passes the challenge bar.
